Creating First Job:
1. Click on New Item.
2. Select Free Style for simple Jenkins Job
3. Skip Source Code Management, Build Environment for simplicity
4. Select Build Triggers and check Build periodically and schedule for 1 min :: For Building after 1 min :: (* * * * *)
4. Goto Build Step and select Execute Shell from DropDown(Add build Step) -- For Linux
5. Enter commands to execute the program.
      For eg:
        cd /home/jibran/Java/
        sudo javac MyFirstProg.java
        java MyFirstProg
6. Run the below command and add the below line to give Jenkins sudo permission:
        sudo gedit /etc/sudoers
        jenkins ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: ALL

Note* : If still we are facing the permission issues then do the below:
  chmod 755 jibran

How chmod works:

r(read)            --4
w(write)           --2
x(execute)         --1
-(no permission)   --0

for example ::
In case of file:  -rw-r--r-- (first letter will -)
In case of dir :  drw-r--r-- (first letter will d)

So if give permission only for read and execute then :
    4+1 == 5

chmod 755 -- this means giving all permissions to user and 5 to group and 5 to others


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Build after other projects are built:

Create 3 jobs:
   1. Build       -- Execute shell(Enter -- cd /home/jibran/Java/ and  sudo javac MyFirstProg.java)
   2. Run         -- Execute shell(Enter -- cd /home/jibran/Java/ and  sudo java MyFirstProg)
   3. Display     -- Execute shell(Enter --  echo "------Success-----")


Goto Run configuration and select - Build after other projects are built and choose Build in the autocomplete
Goto Display configuration and select - Build after other projects are built and choose Run in the autocomplete

This means that after completing Build job, run job will be triggered and after completing run job , Display job is triggered.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Build trigger remotely

Goto configuration of the job and select Build trigger remotely. Give the token there (For eg 12345) and copy the URL mentioned there.
